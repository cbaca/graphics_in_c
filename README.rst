Windmill3D
==========

A program that will generate a 3D windmill

Dependencies:
    SOIL.h
    openGL/glew.h
    glfw3

Resources:
    learnopengl.com

Home workspace:
    4.7.2-1-ARCH x86_64 GNU/Linux
    Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2320 CPU @ 3.00GHz (sandybridge)

Current state:
    Successfully drawing a 2D rectangle with colors and texture from png

Todo:
    -Make matrix maths for model matrix
        -try x86intrin.h for vectorization
    -Keyboard input handling

New things I learned:
    -C allows main() to be called recursively (not tested)
